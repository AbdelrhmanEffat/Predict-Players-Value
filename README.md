# Predict-Players-Value
Building a statistical model to predict the value of new players based on FIFA 2019 top 157 player


We began with some data wrangling, what descriptive statistics can provide me with information about the data, then we found the correlation between variables we are interested in studying, and here as we are trying to predict dependent quantitative variable "Value" using independent variable "Overall" we used Simple Linear Regression, also because we met the assumptions of minimum sample size, linearity, normality, and Homogeneity of variance.
Here by avoiding some errors like overfitting by using visualizations to better see how our model performs we managed to predict the market value.
