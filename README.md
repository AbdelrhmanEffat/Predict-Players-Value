**Project Title:** Building a Statistical Model to Predict New Player Values from FIFA 2019 Top 157 Players

**Project Description:**
In this project, we aimed to predict the market value of new football players using statistical modeling techniques. We began by performing data wrangling to prepare the dataset for analysis. This process involved cleaning, transforming, and organizing the data to make it suitable for modeling.

**Descriptive Statistics:**
Descriptive statistics were employed to gain insights into the dataset. These statistics provided key information about the central tendencies, variations, and distributions of the variables of interest.

**Correlation Analysis:**
We conducted a correlation analysis to assess the relationships between various variables. In particular, we focused on the correlation between the dependent variable, "Value" (the market value of players), and the independent variable, "Overall" (a player's overall rating in FIFA 2019).

**Simple Linear Regression:**
As our primary goal was to predict the market value ("Value") based on the player's overall rating ("Overall"), we used Simple Linear Regression. This technique is appropriate when we have one dependent quantitative variable and one independent variable. We confirmed that the assumptions of linear regression, including minimum sample size, linearity, normality, and homogeneity of variance, were met.

**Model Evaluation:**
To ensure the accuracy and reliability of our model, we took steps to avoid common pitfalls like overfitting. We used data visualization techniques to assess how well the model performed and make necessary adjustments for better predictive accuracy.

**Conclusion:**
Through our data analysis and modeling efforts, we successfully developed a statistical model that predicts the market value of new football players based on their overall rating in FIFA 2019. This model has the potential to provide valuable insights for player valuation and recruitment in the football industry.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Data wrangling is essential to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Descriptive statistics offer insights into data characteristics.
- Correlation analysis helps identify relationships between variables.
- Simple Linear Regression is suitable for predicting a quantitative dependent variable.
- Model evaluation, including visualization, ensures model accuracy.

This project demonstrates your ability to apply statistical analysis and modeling techniques to real-world data, making it a valuable asset for potential investors or stakeholders.
